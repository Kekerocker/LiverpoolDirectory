# LiverpoolDirectory

Well, making this app for a public in a social network VK (for practice). 
Want to make a comfort application to follow "Liverpool FC" with their EPL table position, close matches, history of club and so on.
At the moment of writing it (07 December 2020 21:02) I'm working with VK api using Retrofit 2 library. Want to get information from VK Group wall called "Liverpool FC" for application in "Social" menu.
Still in work.

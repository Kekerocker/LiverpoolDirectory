# LiverpoolDirectory

Well, making this app for a public in social network VK (for practice). 
Want to make comfort application to follow Liverpool FC with their EPL table position, close matches, history of club and so on.
At the moment of writing it (07 December 2020 21:02) I'm working with VK api using Retrofit 2 library. Want to get information from VK Group wall called "Liverpool FC" to application
in "Social" menu. Still in work, so some stuff is working, some stuff isn't.
